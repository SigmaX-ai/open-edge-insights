## Multi-instance feature support for the Builder script with the DiscoverHistory tool

The multi-instance feature support of Builder works only for the video pipeline (`[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/usecase/video-streaming.yml`). For more details, refer to the [EII core readme](https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md#running-builder-to-generate-multi-instance-configs)

In the following example you can view how to change the configuration to use the builder.py script -v 2 feature with 2 instances of the DiscoverHistory tool enabled:
